# Introduction 
    Creating of this project and the request for this module give us vision for what developers job is. Giving us a clue of structure and criteria for planning and create a full stack web application. Developing and design from zero it wasn`t a easy task to do, creating a web pages, connected to each other with paths and routes with secured connection to database, installing scripts and dependencies gives a lot of questions and errors which had take time to understand and fix it. But satisfaction of achieving results and building a knowledge worth it.

# System overview 
    As a full stack web application should be created front end related to the client, back end ralated to server software and  both needs connected to data base 

    - As a data server for this project its used  MongoDB with localhost:27017
